# 🎲 Roll a Dice

🔗 **Live Demo:**  
👉 https://b1stmode.github.io/Roll-A-Dice_Project/

A simple web-based dice rolling app built with **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**.  
The project started as part of a structured course and was later **expanded and modified independently**.

## 📌 What This Project Is

Roll a Dice simulates rolling one or more dice with an animated roll effect and keeps a visible history of previous results.

The focus of this project is **DOM manipulation, state handling, and basic UI logic**, not visual polish or game complexity.

## 🎮 Features

- Dice roll animation triggered by a button
- Random number generation (1–6)
- Roll history list that updates after each roll
- Second dice with independent logic and history
- Button to clear all roll history
- Responsive and readable layout

---

## ✨ What I Added Beyond the Course

- Second dice with separate roll tracking
- Independent history list for each dice
- Clear history button that resets stored roll data
- Improved layout and spacing
- Custom CSS styling beyond the course design

These changes required restructuring the original logic instead of copying it.
